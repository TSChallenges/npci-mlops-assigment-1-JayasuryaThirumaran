On a scorching hot day, a thirsty crow was flying high in the sky, feeling the burning heat of the sun. He had been flying over fields and forests for what seemed like hours, desperately searching for a source of water. His throat was dry, and his wings felt weak from the fatigue. His vision began to blur, and just as he was about to give up, he noticed something unusual in the distance—a glimmer of light, perhaps from a tree. He decided to fly closer, hoping to find some shade or, perhaps, a place to rest.

As he flew nearer, the crow saw something that made his heart leap with joy—a water jug, sitting under the shade of a large tree. His wings flapped faster with excitement, and he quickly swooped down towards the jug, eager to quench his thirst. When he reached the jug, he could clearly see that there was water inside. The sight of the clear liquid made him feel a wave of relief. His parched throat was aching for just a sip of that water.

However, his joy was short-lived as he tried to drink. The neck of the jug was narrow, and he couldn't fit his beak into the opening. The crow stretched and twisted his neck as far as he could, but it was no use. The opening was just too small. He stepped back and tried another approach. Maybe he could tilt the jug to pour out some water. But to his dismay, the jug was heavy and could not be easily moved. The water inside stayed firmly in place, mocking the crow’s attempts.

Just then, a young boy named Muta, who had been walking along the path near the tree, noticed the crow’s struggles. Muta was a kind-hearted boy who loved animals and always paid attention to the little things around him. He stopped and watched the crow for a moment, curious about what the bird was trying to do.

“Poor bird, you're thirsty, aren’t you?” Muta said softly, stepping closer. The crow looked up, surprised by the boy’s voice, but he didn’t fly away. Instead, he continued to stare at the jug, frustrated and exhausted.

Muta knelt down beside the tree and watched the crow for a while, thinking about how he might help. "Hmm," he muttered to himself, "the jug is too heavy for you, and the neck is too narrow for you to reach the water. How can we solve this?"

After a moment of deep thought, Muta’s face lit up with an idea. He stood up and ran to the nearby field, looking for something he could use. Soon, he returned with a handful of small, smooth pebbles. “I think I have an idea,” Muta said with a smile as he knelt down again and began to drop the pebbles into the jug, one by one.

The crow watched, intrigued by what Muta was doing. With each pebble that dropped into the jug, the water level began to rise ever so slowly. The crow’s eyes widened in understanding. It wasn’t just the boy who was helping—it was his clever idea that was starting to work.

Muta kept adding pebbles until the water level had risen enough for the crow to drink. The bird’s beak dipped into the water, and he took a long, refreshing sip. The crow fluttered his wings in joy, grateful for both Muta’s kindness and his brilliant idea.

"Thank you, little friend," Muta said softly as the crow drank, feeling a sense of accomplishment. He was happy to have been able to help the bird, even though it was just a small gesture. The crow looked up at Muta and gave a thankful caw before flying off into the sky, his thirst quenched.

As the crow flew away, Muta stood up, feeling proud of his resourcefulness and his ability to help a creature in need. He smiled to himself, thinking that sometimes, the simplest solutions can solve the biggest problems. Muta knew that this experience was a reminder that with patience, kindness, and creativity, even the smallest of us could make a big difference.

With a last look at the empty jug, Muta continued on his way, his heart light and happy from the good deed he had done that day. And from high above, the crow circled the sky, perhaps watching over Muta, knowing that his thirst had been quenched thanks to the boy’s thoughtful actions.
